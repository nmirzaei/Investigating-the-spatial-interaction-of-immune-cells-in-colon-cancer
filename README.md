# Investigating-the-spatial-interaction-of-immune-cells-in-colon-cancer

In this study, we develop a system of PDEs coupled with a linear elasticity model to investigate the effects of these spatial interactions on the tumor microenvironment's progression and spatial arrangement. We observe two major patterns that most cells and cytokines follow, which are heavily affected by macrophages or substances produced by them. We also see that cytotoxic cells are quickly recruited to the site of macrophages and then suppressed by them. We also investigate the difference in the tumor microenvironment arrangement in the presence of anti-tumor and pro-tumor macrophages. We observe that anti-tumor macrophages reorganize the microenvironment patterns in favor of a more centralized cancer and necrotic core. They also fail to sabotage the cytotoxic response of the T-cells, while pro-tumor macrophages have the opposite impact. Finally, we perform a comprehensive sensitivity analysis with four objective functions related to the total cancer population, total cancer-immune cells ratio, and the magnitude and direction of the cells' movement. Most sensitive parameters for all these objective functions are directly related to macrophages, and perturbing them causes a significant change in the arrangement and concentration of all cells and cytokines in the model.
